## Analysis

The analysis Python script runs in Python 2.7 and requires matplotlib, numpy and the mysql connector plugins to be installed. The script connects to a MySQL database, extracts and collates the relevant data into objects, and then generates a number of CSVs and PDF graphs.

Configure the script at the top of the file.
